# Overview #
It is critical to maintaining a good digital lab notebook that you record the specific order various programs/scripts/software are used. There are several ways that we can do this using a variety of tools and platforms. This vignette will focus on the `history` and `script` functions that are built into most unix distributions. These tools are good for recording what is actually being typed into the terminal, but these tools typically will not give great context for the why behind the action. In order to get this context, its important to write good README files and keep good GitHub repositories where you can write up the entire workflow and provide insight into why you are doing what you're doing. 

# Using the history function #
The unix shell automatically records all of the commands input into the shell using the `history` function. Simply type `history` will bring up a numbered list of all the commands used with higher number indicating the more recent commands. This list can be very helpful to consult when writing up and summarizing your workflows since it provides an exact record of what you did and in what order. There are also a couple of useful utilities built into the history function. 

## rerunning previous commands ##
## Modifying the history file ##
