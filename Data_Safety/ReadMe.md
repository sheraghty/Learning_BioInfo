# Best Practices in Data Safety #
## The 3-2-1 rule ##
This rule provides guidance on how to best store data and ensure its safety. In the context of bioinformatics, its best to apply this rule to sequencing data (although it really should be applied to any raw data being used in analyses e.g. morphological data or sample information). The 3 refers to the number of copies of data that should exist. This means that all raw data should exist in triplicate. The 2 refers to the number of different storage media (e.g. cloud storage or on removable hard drive) and the 1 refers to the number of copies that should exist “offsite” (e.g. not in the lab). The meaning of offsite here can be a little nuanced. Your office/lab may also be in approximately the same location as where the servers for your computational platform are, so the data stored on your servers and a hard driver in the office/lab are effectively in the same place. Basically, the spirit of this rule is that if there is some sort of catastrophic event, like a fire or earthquake, then the offsite copy should be far enough way to be safe. A good guideline might be that offsite should mean that it is not located on the same research campus where you conduct your research. 
There are some other considerations as well that may be relevant depending on the nature of the data you have. For instance, some guidelines also add that caveat that one (or more) of the data copies should be “air gapped”, which means on a storage medium that is not connected to the internet (e.g. a removable drive). This copy should also be made to be immutable, or in other words it needs to be made such that it cannot be edited. One final note of caution, when making back-ups it is important to make sure that the process finishes without errors. 
### An example of the 3-2-1 rule in action ### 
To provide an example that might be relevant for bioinformatics scientists, imagine a scenario where we receive a whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset that is ~ 200 Gb in size. Before you begin to analyze the data, it is important to immediately backup the raw data following the 3-2-1 rule. We might accomplish this by creating one copy to be stored on a removable hard drive that is kept either in our office or lab space and then uploading the data to NCBI as well (remember, the data can be uploaded and embargoed until the project is ready to publish). Finally, we upload the data to onto whatever computer server that we are using for data analysis. 

In this example, you comply with the 3-2-1 rule in the following ways
* There are a total of 3 data copies – the hard drive, NCBI, and your computational resources
* There are at least two different storage media – hard drive and cloud (NCBI) 
*	One copy (the data on NCBI) is located offsite (in this scenario lets assume we don’t work for NCBI)
