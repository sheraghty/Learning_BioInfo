# Overview #
Using the `ln` or the link function can be a great way to more efficiently share data across a computing platform or to create easy shortcuts. Basically the ln function allows a single file to basically exist in multiple places at once without being literally copied in both places. This is very useful when we might have very large datasets and don't want them to exist in multiple places on the same system. There are two basic kinds of links - Hard links and soft or symbolic links. See below for more information on the respective type of link
