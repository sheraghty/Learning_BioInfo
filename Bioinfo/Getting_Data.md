# Overview # 
This tutorial will cover the different tools for getting data that is publicly available.

# Introduction #
There is a huge amount of bioinformatic data that is publicly available for analysis and its growing every day. Much of this data is stored on platforms like NCBI, figshare, DRYAD, or any such similar programs. In many cases the data can be downloaded from the repository of interest using your preferred internet browser. However, going about things in this way is usually not very efficient as it adds in several intermediate steps. We are going to want to download things more or less directly using the command line 
# wget #
The easiest way to download data from the internet is to use the `wget` function like we did before to get example files from this GitHub (see below for code). This method is particularly useful when there is a few files that you need and that are being hosted on a website. However, it may not be the most suitable tool when trying to download larger numbers of files (e.g. sequencing data from many samples) or when trying to download data that is not being stored in a standalone file.
