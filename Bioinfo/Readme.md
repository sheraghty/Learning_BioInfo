This directory contains a handful of tutorials that are more or less specific to bioinformatics. Before getting started with this section, its prudent to already have a basic grasp of working in an Unix environment. For folks that might not have prior experiences, it's a good idea to go back through the [bash basics](../Bash_Basics) section and complete those tutorials first
