# Overview #
This directory contains a handful of tutorials that are more or less specific to bioinformatics. Before getting started with this section, its prudent to already have a basic grasp of working in an Unix environment. For folks that might not have prior experiences, it's a good idea to go back through the [bash basics](../Bash_Basics) section and complete those tutorials first. Another important consideration is that workflows and softwares are constantly updating and as such, these tutorials may not always show the most up-to-date information. Additionally, softwares are also constantly updated and if you are using a more recent version of a particular software, some things may differ from the tutorials here. Each tutorial will list the date it was created, the last time it was updated (if applicable), and the versions of pertinent software that were used.
