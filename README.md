# Overview #

This Github is a repository for tutorials and notes that I have complied for learning and the requisite programming skills for bioinformatics research. Much of the focus will be on developing skills in either a Bash shell or in R as these are probably the most commonly used programming languages in a Bioinformatics context. Python is another popular language, but I have a [seperate Github](https://github.com/sheraghty/LearningPython) dedicated to learning Python.
